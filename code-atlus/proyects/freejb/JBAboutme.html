      <h1>About Me</h1> <br>
      <p>I am a vivid Apple enthusiast and a Jailbreak user and follower. I have a history related to jailbreak way back in 2011 when I got my first Apple product, the IPod 4 generation and when I stumble uppon a old how to jailbreak tutorial using a old Redsn0w jailbreak.
      Ever since I followed the comunity from a far because before I didn't exactly have a PC and the correct IOS version to able to Jailbreak it.</p>

    <img usemap="#IPadtweaks" src="CustomIPad1.jpeg" alt="My Personal Custom IPad Pro with Tweaks" <area height="480" width="710">
    <p><i>My personal IPad running the IOS 13.4 Jailbreak. You can also press wheres there's a custom tweak above to visit the tweak page!</i></p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th colspan="2">All my IPad photo <i>(image above)</i> listed Tweaks Name:</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Frame</th>
        <td>It's to add animated wallpaper on both the homescreen and lockscreen</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>HSWidgets</th>
        <td>To get kinda like the homepage widgets on IOS 14 on IOS 13</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Snowboard</th>
        <td>Its the engine on how the custom Icon are running on the device</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>ColorMeNotifs</th>
        <td>Widget <i>and also has notification</i> to change its background blur colors</th>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br> <br>
    <p>Even though my Phone is not currently a IDevice, I still avid Jailbreak supporter and seeing people doing not just once, <strong>multiple attempts</strong> from aforementioned Correllium lawsuit and other events.
    That's one of some more reason I created this website for, spread the word of how Apple monopoly on everything in their platform wants to destroy a comunity of other avid Apple's IOS fans.</p>
